# Java Coding Challenges

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geektimus/java-challenges.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geektimus/java-challenges)

This repo will contain the solutions using Java 8 for challenges found on:

* Books
* Hacker Rank
* Codility
* CodeFights

## Challenges

### Codility

#### Can we sort an array with a simple swap? 
We need to write a function that will return true if we can sort an array swapping only two elements.

### Mystery number
We need to write a function to shuffle the digits on a number on a particular way. The first char with the last char,
the second char with the second to last char until we use all the digits.

### Find the longest sentence.
We have phrases composed by sentences and each of this sentences contain words. We need to write a function that will
give us the number of words on the longest sentence. The sentences are separated by "?", "!", "." and the words simply
by spaces (" ").

### Binary Gap
A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.

### CyclicRotation
We need to perform an array shift to the right a given number of times.

### Hacker Rank
#### Odd number generator.
We need to write a function that return all the odd numbers on a range given the start and the end of the range as
integers. This collection will include the start and end integers if they are odd numbers too

### Books
#### Unique characters
We need to write a function that will tell us if all the characters on a given string are unique.

### Check permutation
We need to write a function that given two strings let us find if one is a permutation of the other.
